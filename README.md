# no - Safe Choice


'no' is a safe and fast version of rm or rm -rf. sometimes we mistakely or without knowing delete our projects and some people do this...
~~~ 
rm -rf / #this causes your OS to become useless.
~~~
And to prevent this we make ths tool this will make the 
~~~
rm or rm -rf *
~~~
much secure.

to use this you'll need to install it then you can use i and you 'rm' will be replaced by 'no'. Not like it willl compltly gone but it will put a safety suit on the 'rm' command.

~~~
rm -> no or rm -rf to no -rf

#instead of using rm you can use no.
#if you use rm then it will work like #before but if you use 'no' then it will #put #a safety suit on 'rm'.
